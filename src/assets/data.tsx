  "bio": `Marmaduke Dando is the bard of disempire, a crooner of morose ballads and fiery diatribes, often eliciting references to The Bad Seeds, Roxy Music, and Scott Walker. He writes about the horrors of the modern world, and barks back at it with his 5 piece organ-fuelled band. Born and bred from genuine pirate stock in Portsmouth, England, he moved to London to slog his guts out in iniquitous music halls and shame inducing conference calls. Now recently fled the city for the desolate volcanic vistas of the island of Lanzarote. Of his music, Steve Lamacq, BBC6 Music, has said it's "...distinctively haunting...", and Charlie Ashcroft, Artrocker, like "...poetry in motion...". His songs have been set to films, woven into a seminal Secret Cinema event, and played in the Houses of Parliament. He releases his third album come October 2015, entitled 'Where The Wasteland Ends'.`,
